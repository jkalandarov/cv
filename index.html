    <div class="about_me_body">
      <p>I've found my passion in web devlopment. I've non-programming background, BSc in Economics and MBA in Finace. I've
      worked in different areas but finally find the job I love and enjoy doing in programming. I never get tired of doing this job
      even working 14-16 hours a day.</p>
      <p>I decided to become a web developer when I relized endless opportunities in programming back in 2014. That time,
      there were no programming bootcamps in my hometown, internet was slow and expensive, and few existing programmers did not want to teach others.
      It is still impossible to find decent bootcamps or instructors here, but those can't stop me from becoming developer. In 2017, I enrolled in MBA program,
      and I moved to capital city, Tashkent, to pursue the program. I was working 9 am to 5 pm, teaching English 6pm to 8pm three days a week, and sometimes
      doing freelance accounting for some entreprenuers to earn for living. As soon as when I got home, I ran to my laptop to learn Java programming.
      After 6-7 months of learning Java, I started making real basic Android apps like calculators. Yet they were simple, but they were fruits of my hard work.
      </p>
      <p>After finishing MBA, I had to return to my hometown and took a job that I enjoyed doing least. The salary was good, but also the working hours were
      not limited. Our boss would let us go home whenever he wanted. Typical government job in Uzbekistan. So, I paused my journey for some time. After
      2 months of working there I had to quit. Since then I have been working in textiles and got promoted job on October, 2019.</p>
      <p>Despite the fact, I am working at Executive level at the moment, I've not given up becoming a developer. Due to COVID-19 pandemic, we had to close factory.
      Since February 2020, I've been committing my 16 hours everyday to mastering web programming. Currently, I'm learning intermediate front-end dev and
      gaining skills and experience day by day. As soon as having necessary front-end development skills and knowledge in my arsenal, I want to deep dive
      into back-end development as I find it challenging. I'm looking forward to learning Node.js along with its frameworks, and Kotlin for Android programming.
      I believe it will be future of Android programming language.</p>
